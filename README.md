**To my students (BSIT-2A-DAY & 2B-DAY):**

I just wanted to take a sec to say I really appreciate you guys. I know this stuff isnt always easy, I know we got a lot of time constraints, some stuff we werent able to do fully, but you showed up and built some really cool things.

Im proud of the work you've done. Keep coding, keep learning, and dont be afraid to try new ideas, lezgoo!
