    <h2>Why I Want to Learn to Code</h2>
    <time datetime="2025-09-25">September 25, 2025</time>
    <p>
      I want to learn to code because it helps me create solutions, bring ideas to life, and solve real-world problems. It also strengthens my logical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential in today’s technology-driven world. <br> As <q>Bill Gates</q> once said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>“Learning to write programs stretches your mind and helps you think better, 
      creating a way of thinking about things that I think is helpful in all domains.”</blockquote>
