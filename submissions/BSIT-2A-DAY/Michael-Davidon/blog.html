      <h3>My Journey in Learning Programming</h3>
      <p>
        Learning <strong>programming</strong> has been one of the most exciting experiences in my life. 
        It taught me patience, problem-solving, and how to think logically.
        Every time I finish a project, I feel more confident and motivated to keep going.

      <h3>Why I Love Playing Video Games</h3>
      <p>
        Video games are more than just entertainment for me. They teach teamwork, 
        strategy, and creativity. Games like Dota 2 and Minecraft
        help me relax after a long day of studying. They also inspire me to learn more about 
        game development in the future.
