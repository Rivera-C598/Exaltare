            <p><q>The moon is beautiful isn't it?</q> Yes, it is. Couldn't help but stop and stare at the moon. It's shining down so softly, lighting up the darkness. It has that classic, calming glow that makes you just want to sit and watch it. It's amazing how it can be so far away but still feel so comforting and pretty.</p>

            <p>High School graduation. An event that marked my high school life <q>The End</q>. My years in high school, for me, is one that I will always cherished. It is where I met most of my best friends and a lot of acquaintances. Where I discovered different versions of my self that I never thought I had, and feelings that I never thought that I will feel.</p>
            <p>The graduation got me teary-eyed, because I know I will miss a lot of people. And despite my love-hate relationship in school, I know that I will miss walking through the hallways of the building. The graduation was what made me realized that I really finished high school (without getting pregnant lol). </p>
            <p>I also didn't wished for anything big, just hoping that I will be one of the honors. But God planned and gived me way bigger than what I wished. I got the honor of doing the pledge of loyalty on our batch (TVL Track). It is something I didn't expect that will happen. While standing in the middle of the stage, watching my fellow graduates in front of me, I feel very proud. We've achieved another milestone, and to all graduates of this batch, I just wanna say, CONGRATULATIONS!!</p>

            <h2>Movie Series</h2>

            <p>One thing I didn't tell to a lot of people is that I am a potterhead. I may watch a lot of movie series but no one can replace this movie series who captured my young heart. I first watched it when I was still in grade 5. You might asked, <em><q>What is a potterhead?</q></em>, well for me it's someone who likes the <a href="https://www.harrypotter.com/" target="_blank">Harry Potter</a> movie series. The movie series has 8 movies, which are the:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</li>
                <li>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</li>
                <li>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</li>
                <li>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</li>
                <li>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</li>
                <li>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</li>
                <li>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1</li>
                <li>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Out of all the movie in the series, my favorite is the second one which is the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.</p>
            <p>Fun fact is this movie series is adapted from the book series of the same name. It is written by J.K. Rowling. Soon, if I will have the money, I will buy the whole set of the book series.</p>
