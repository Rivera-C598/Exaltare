        <h2>Why I Love Genshin Impact</h2>
        <time datetime="2025-09-28">September 28, 2025</time>
        <p>My most favorite game to play is <cite><strong>Genshin Impact</strong></cite>. 
        I really enjoy how beautiful the world looks — every place feels like an adventure. 
        Exploring Teyvat and doing co-op makes me feel relaxed, especially when I'm emotionally stressed.</p>

        <p>I also like the characters a lot. Each one has their own story, personality, and unique character designs, which makes the game more exciting. Sometimes I spend more time following the main quest or event story than actual battles because I enjoy the story and lore more (I especially like seeing cutscenes!). But of course, that doesn't mean I don't love the fighting or gameplay. They are the best!</p>

        <p>For me, Genshin is <em>not just a game</em> — it holds many precious memories and friends that inspire me and allow me to overcome even my lowest moments.</p>

        <h2>Why I Love Cakes and Fries</h2>
        <time datetime="2025-09-28">September 28, 2025</time>
        <p>If there are two foods that always make me happy, they’re definitely <strong>cakes</strong> and <strong>fries</strong>. I don’t usually eat cakes during celebrations — I eat them when I suddenly <em>crave</em> something sweet and creamy. Every slice feels like a little treat just for myself, whether it’s chocolate, strawberry, or anything with cream.</p>

        <p>Fries, on the other hand, are my go-to comfort food. They’re crispy, filled with many flavors, and 
        perfect for snacking while studying, gaming, or just relaxing. Sometimes I even joke 
        that fries can fix a bad day better than most things!</p>

        <p>For me, cakes and fries balance each other out — one sweet, one savory — and both 
        always bring me comfort and happiness.</p>
