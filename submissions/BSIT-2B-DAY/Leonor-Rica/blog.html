      <h3>Haunted Boarding House I Will Never Forget</h3>

      <p>
        When I moved to the city for college, I was just like any other student—eager, broke, and desperate for a cheap place to stay.
        I thought I struck gold when I found an <strong>old boarding house</strong> just a few streets away from campus.
        The rent was low, the landlady seemed welcoming, and the location was perfect.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “But sometimes, <em>cheap comes with a price you never expect.</em>”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The first few nights were fine. My room was small but decent: a bed, a desk, and a creaky old wooden cabinet.
        The <em>house itself felt a little too quiet,</em> but I brushed it off. However, things started to change after the first week.
        Then came the <i>fourth night.</i> I was woken up by the sound of footsteps outside my door. When I peeked through the peephole,
        <strong>no one was there.</strong> The footsteps continued, pacing back and forth, growing louder and more deliberate.

        I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination, but the next night, the <em>footsteps returned.</em>
        This time, they were accompanied by a <em><b>faint whispering sound.</b></em>
        Instead of knocking, the wooden cabinet inside my room <strong>slowly creaked open.</strong>
        <em><b>Two pale hands stretched out from the darkness, followed by a face with sunken eyes, peeling skin, and a grin too wide to belong to any living thing.</b></em>
      </p>

      <p>
        It crawled forward, whispering in a rasp that froze my blood:
        <strong>“You took my room.”</strong> I tried to run, but the door slammed shut by itself. The figure inched closer—until it slipped back inside the cabinet, leaving me <em>trembling in the dark.</em>

        <strong>The next morning,</strong> I packed my bags and left the boarding house without looking back.
        I never found out <em>who—or what—haunted that place,</em> but I learned a valuable lesson:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        “Sometimes, cheap comes with a price you never expect — the cost of your sanity or your soul.”
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        So I’ll leave you with this question:
        <strong>Would you dare stay in that boarding house?</strong>
