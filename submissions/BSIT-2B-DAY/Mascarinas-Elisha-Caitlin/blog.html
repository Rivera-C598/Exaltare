         <h2>"Family is not an important thing, it's everything".</h2>
         <time datetime="2025-09-29">May 29, 2025</time>

         <p>Hello! My name is Elisha Caitlin and I am currently a student who loves to learn 
        and explore new things. I was born in a small town where I grew up in a loving family of five 
        - my parents, my two siblings, and me the ate. There are times in life when we doubt ourselves and think we cannot succeed.
        As a student, there were moments when I felt like giving up because schoolwork became too difficult, stressed about deadlines,
         projects, and exams. I thought, “Maybe I am not good enough.” But then my family reminded me that I am capable and strong.</p>

         <p> Growing up, my family always encouraged me to continue and reminded me of all the things I had already achieved. 
        Their words gave me hope and the confidence to keep going even when I wanted to stop. It made me realize that failure only happens when 
        you stop trying. But Ive learned that hard work and discipline pay off.</p>
         
         <p>Family support can turn doubt into determination. Knowing that they believe in me helps me believe in myself. Because of them, 
        I keep working hard and never give up on my dreams. I try to stay motivated by setting small goals every day and celebrating my progress. Even when things get tough, 
         I remind myself that this is part of growing and preparing for the future.</p>

        <h2>My Family Bond</h2>
        <time datetime="2025-09-25">June 25, 2025</time>
        <p>One of the best ways my family spends time together is by eating outside. Whether it is at a park, a restaurant, or a small 
         food stall, sharing a meal outside always feels special. It gives us a chance to take a break from our busy lives and enjoy each 
         others company.</p>
        
        <p>When we eat outside, we talk about many things—our day at school or work, our plans for the weekend, and even funny memories from
         the past. These conversations make us laugh and bring us closer as a family. Eating together outside also lets us try new foods, which 
         becomes a fun adventure for all of us.</p>
