            <h2> My Betta Babies </h2>
            <time datetime="2025-09-26">September 26, 2025</time>

            <p> Keeping a fish was never on my bingo card. I just loved watching fish videos on TikTok — until
                one day, it led me to actually get a fish of my own. My kuya once had a betta fish, but sadly, they all
                died
                because he didn’t have time to take care of them — he was busy with work. So, I decided to reuse the
                old aquarium he left and turn it into a home for my own fish. My first betta fish was blue. I bought it
                from a street vendor in Danao, right beside City Mall. I named her Coco. She’s kind of nonchalant and
                chill. My second betta was a gift from our neighbor, who breeds betta fish. He’s red, tiny, and very
                cute. I
                named him Popo. His personality is the total opposite of Coco — he’s super jolly and energetic.My third
                betta is named Wowo. She has a soft pink color (well, not fully pink), and she’s also very lively. I
                feel like
                she understands me easily.They’re all super cute, and I love them so much. </p>

            <h2> My love for Gardening </h2>
            <time datetime="2025-26-18">September 26, 2025</time>
            <p> Whenever school feels overwhelming, I grab my tools and spend an hour with my plants.
                There's something peaceful about watering, trimming, and just watching things grow.I started loving
                gardening because of my father. He’s always been passionate about it. He grows vegetables like corn,
                eggplants, beans, okra, and different types of chili peppers. Gardening is really a hands-on,
                nature-filled
                activity — and honestly, it’s good for the soul.Every morning before I go to school, I make sure to
                shower
                my plants with water. It's become a small but meaningful routine that helps me start the day with calm
                and care.What makes it really fun is seeing your plants healthy and thriving — it feels like you're
                doing
                something right. Watching new leaves grow or seeing a flower bloom gives me a little spark of joy, like
                nature is giving me a reward for being patient.Gardening has taught me a lot — not just about plants,
                but also about finding peace in small things. </p>
