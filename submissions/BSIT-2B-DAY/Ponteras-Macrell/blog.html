          <h2>My Journey as a instrumentalist</h2>
          <time datetime="09-26-2025">September 09, 2025</time>
      <p>My journey as an instrumentalist began with the JBrothers DBC group, where I first honed my skills and built the foundation of my musical path. Being part of that group gave me the chance to explore different styles, rhythms, and ensemble playing. It was in JBrothers DBC that I developed the discipline of rehearsals, teamwork, and learning how each instrument contributes to the harmony of the whole performance. Those early years shaped my passion for music and gave me the confidence to grow not only as a player but also as a collaborator.</p>
      <p>Later, I transitioned to the 3J DBC group, which marked a new chapter in my growth as an instrumentalist. With 3J, I faced fresh challenges, more complex arrangements, and opportunities to perform in settings that pushed me beyond my comfort zone. This group taught me how to adapt quickly, refine my technical skills, and embrace creativity while performing. The shift from JBrothers to 3J wasn’t just about moving to a different group it was about leveling up, expanding my musical identity, and continuing the journey of becoming the best instrumentalist I can be.</p>
