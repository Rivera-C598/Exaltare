    <h2>Life as a Friendly Person</h2>
    <time datetime="2025-09-25">September 25, 2025</time>
    <p>Being friendly is not as simple as just smiling at people; it's about helping others feel recognized and appreciated. A simple "hello" or any small act of kindness can potentially change people's bad days into good days. I love seeing and meeting new people, listening to their stories, and establishing friendships that will make the world feel a little warmer. At the end of the day, it is not expensive to be friendly/kind; rather the act lasts a lifetime without us remembering.</p>

    <h2>Life as a Working Student</h2>
     <time datetime="2025-09-25">September 25, 2025</time>
    <p>It is no doubt, a challenge to be a working student but it is also a rewarding experience. The combination of classes, homework and deadlines in addition to a job helps develop your skills in time management, responsibility and perseverance. Some days are more difficult than others, but every small win—whether it's a quiz you were nervous about or just finishing your shift—gives me that reminder that I can push through. The grind now will turn into something meaningful in the long run.</p>
