            <h2>Max Verstappen: The Dominant Force in F1</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-09-25">September 25, 2025</time>
            <p>
                Max Verstappen, a Dutch racing driver for <strong>Red Bull Racing</strong>, has become one of the most dominant figures in modern Formula 1.  
                Known for his <em>aggressive driving style</em> and incredible consistency, Verstappen has redefined what it means to be a champion in motorsport.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since making his debut at just 17 years old, he has broken multiple records, including being the youngest driver to win a Grand Prix.  
                His recent seasons have shown <mark>near-total dominance</mark>, often finishing far ahead of the competition.  
                Fans admire his fearlessness, while rivals respect his precision on track.

            <h2>My Journey and Dreams</h2>
            <time datetime="2025-09-25">September 25, 2025</time>
            <p>
                Since childhood, I have always dreamed of becoming an <strong>IT professional</strong>. Choosing 
                <abbr title="Bachelor of Science in Information Technology">BSIT</abbr> in college was not just a random decision—it was a path I had envisioned from the start.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, as I turn <mark>21 this coming October 22</mark>(already 21 lol), I’ve noticed changes in myself.  
                I play fewer games and focus more on <em>enhancing my skills</em>, gaining new knowledge, and surrounding myself with people who can guide me toward a better future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Life has given me many challenges, and I treat them as part of my growth.  
                Even when survival feels hard, we must <strong>keep showing up</strong> and <strong>never give up</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the next <mark>five years</mark>, I see myself in a stable job or building my own business — or both.
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>Don’t think too much about the future. Explore new things that can benefit your career. Always be kind, stay humble, and live the life you truly want.</q>
            </p>
